    "- +1 bonus point (grading *Pass with honors*) requires a **completely** correct solution and also thorough analysis. \n",
    "- If you encounter problems, Google first. If you can't find an answer to the problem, don't hesitate to ask in the Moodle discussion or directly via moodle chat or email from the course assistant responsible for the exercise, Valtteri Nieminen, vajnie@utu.fi <font color = red></font>\n",
